<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The rules below were drafted from three primary sources: the results of the Google form, rules from previous iterations of the game, and input from the SGA, Nick, and Johannes. If you have concerns, feel free to reach out.</p>
<p><strong>Void all rules where administration steps in:</strong> Nick and Ellie will not interfere with the votes under any circumstances.</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Teams can consist of either one or two players.</li>
    <li>Once teams are formed, they cannot be changed.</li>
    <li>Each team must sign up with a team name and photo.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Game Logic</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The game is divided into multiple rounds.</li>
    <li>Round start and end time/dates, along with how many rounds will be played, will be announced before.</li>
    <li>At the beginning of each round, teams are assigned a new target.</li>
    <li>At the end of each round:
        <ul>
            <li>If a team has eliminated all of their targets, they move on. Any eliminated players are revived.</li>
            <li>If a team has eliminated one of their targets, then they move on. Eliminated players are not revived.</li>
            <li>If a team fails to eliminate any of their targets, their team is eliminated by the system.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The final round will be a free for all, where teams are instructed to target all remaining players. Last team standing during the free for all wins 1st place. 2nd through 5th place is determined by the number of kills.</li>
</ul>
